## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
In terms of outside resources, I only used my css/html notes from when I first started learning web development and the w3schools website.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

One challenge I had to solve while submitting this project was making sure I didn't mess up the code. 
In particular, I had to be careful when I was adding the optional features such as including the fifth button. 
I had to make sure that all the five buttons had their own style and tone. 
At the same time, I had to also make sure all the buttons had the same functions and qualities for the game to work. 
It was important that I checked back on each required feature and debug to make sure the program still worked accordingly. 
When writing the code, it was very important that I was organized and made a mental note so that I knew what functions were doing what. 
In addition, I forgot a few concepts while doing the assignment. Fortunately, the drop down information boxes on the code path course page helped me with 
tips and refreshers on how to access the needed features.



3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

One of the many questions I have about web development is how does a team work on a web development project together? 
Another questions I had was how does a brand and a developer communicate on what the brand wants on there platform? Is there an effecient way to 
break down workloads when the brand consists of multiple ideas that need to be shown as well? Lastly, what are some good habits for a web developer 
to have? Speaking of habits, I would also like to ask what are some common mistakes or bad practices web developers can make? 
In the end, I feel like there are numerous web developers who are capable of really cool creations. The main question I woudl have is when 
should you work towards an idea knowing that the end result will be worth while because projects can be very time consuming.


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had more time, I wish I spent time on learning more javascript because it is a crucial language that makes the whole program function.
I would also do some mini projects on the side with javascript so I would get better at working and debugging with javascript. If I had more knowledge about javascript,
I could've added more optional features such as increasing the playback speed and creating a randomizer to randomize the pattern each time the game is started. 
I was scared that by the time I would read up and learn more about javascript, I would not have enough time to submit the project or mess up another function's code. As a result, I stuck with what I know.
One thing for sure is I'll be continuing to work on this on my free time to add as many optional features as possible so that I can get comfortable with javascript.
